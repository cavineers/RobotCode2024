Robot Code for the 2024 FRC Season -- Crescendo.

## Proper use notes & warnings

In the case of the re-homing of CANCoders, follow these instructions:
- Set the offset to zero in the code
- Face the wheel bolt outward to find the offset needed to set in code
- If the wheel is spinning in the wrong direction but pose is correct, add .5 to the offset.
- If the wheel offset is not moving at the correct angle, inverse the sign of the offset.
